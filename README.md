This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon error in Python exception handling. The `bug.py` file shows a function that handles ZeroDivisionError and TypeError, but neglects other possible exceptions like ValueError.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a more robust solution.  The error is subtle, highlighting the importance of considering all potential exception types and implementing appropriate input validation.
